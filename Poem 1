As if Syn Bio weren't enough
To find the diamonds in the rough
It helps you to create something
Three inhibitors in a ring
Up and down the signal bounces
To big smiles and great advances 
Gaining knowledge, taking chances
Great new things the world announces
But old things can be made in a better way
THE END
